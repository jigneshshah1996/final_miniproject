	My program is based on Movie boking ticket System.
	
	I have taken book my show as a refernce for my project.  
	
	In my Program , The user is able to see the Movies that are being shown. 
	It has Multiple screens for booking facility.
	User can select the timing of the show he/she wants to book.
	The seating arrangement is being shown, with the seat numbers on it. 
	As soon as user books tickets, those seats have been stored in an file.
	Next time it checks the seats that are already occupied and shows the seats accordingly.
	
	Tickets once sold cannot be cancelled , so it gives a warning and asks for confirmation before proceeding to paymnet. 
	
	New User has to create his create his own account.
	Then user gives his details like name, mobile number and all, and can select his payment option. 
	All these have been stored in a file in by a stucure variable of a customer	
	The ticket is shown on the screen.
		
	If you want change the name of movies and timings in future, just change the arrays specified in the main.c
	
	ADMIN : The password for admin is 'password'. 
	The password is encrypted.
	The admin can view all the bookings including their personal information seat numbers and all.
	At the end of the day he can reset all bookings by deleting the txt files of each show.
	After this all booked seats are gone, and shows vacant screens.
	
	BUGS : 
	Dont press anything other than options provided each time, otherwise it exits the program OR goes into an infinite loop.
